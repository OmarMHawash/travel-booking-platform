# Implementation Plan: Personalized Recently Visited

> **Feature**: Home Page - Personalized Recently Visited  
> **Status**: Planning  
> **Created**: 2025-01-08  
> **Planner**: System

## Background and Motivation

The current home page provides generic content (featured deals and popular destinations) for all users. Adding personalized "Recently Visited" functionality will:

1. **Enhance User Experience**: Show users content relevant to their browsing history
2. **Increase Engagement**: Help users quickly find hotels they've previously viewed
3. **Improve Conversion**: Reduce friction in rebooking or revisiting interesting hotels
4. **Personalization Foundation**: Establish user activity tracking infrastructure for future features

### Current Home Page Implementation

The existing `/api/v1/search/home-page` endpoint returns:

```json
{
  "FeaturedDeals": [...],
  "PopularDestinations": [...],
  "LastUpdated": "timestamp"
}
```

### Target Enhancement

Enhanced home page with personalized content:

```json
{
  "FeaturedDeals": [...],
  "PopularDestinations": [...],
  "RecentlyVisited": [...],  // NEW: User's recently viewed hotels
  "LastUpdated": "timestamp"
}
```

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### 1. **User Activity Tracking Infrastructure Missing**

- **Challenge**: No system currently tracks user interactions with hotels
- **Impact**: Need to build user activity tracking from scratch
- **Approach**: Implement lightweight activity logging with minimal performance impact

### 2. **Hotel Detail Views Not Implemented**

- **Challenge**: "Recently visited" typically means "recently viewed hotel details"
- **Current State**: Hotel search exists, but no hotel detail endpoint
- **Approach**: Implement hotel detail endpoint first, then add view tracking

### 3. **User Context in Home Page**

- **Challenge**: Current home page is anonymous/generic
- **Current State**: No user authentication required for home page
- **Approach**: Make recently visited optional (authenticated users only)

### 4. **Performance Considerations**

- **Challenge**: User activity tracking shouldn't impact search performance
- **Approach**: Asynchronous activity logging with background processing

### 5. **Data Privacy and Retention**

- **Challenge**: User activity data requires privacy considerations
- **Approach**: Configurable retention periods and user control

## Technical Specifications

### User Activity Entity Design

```csharp
public class UserActivity : AggregateRoot
{
    public Guid UserId { get; private set; }
    public ActivityType Type { get; private set; }
    public Guid? TargetId { get; private set; }
    public string? TargetType { get; private set; }
    public string? Metadata { get; private set; }
    public DateTime ActivityDate { get; private set; }

    // Methods for creating different activity types
    public static UserActivity CreateHotelView(Guid userId, Guid hotelId);
    public static UserActivity CreateSearch(Guid userId, string searchTerm, Guid? cityId = null);
}

public enum ActivityType
{
    HotelView = 1,
    Search = 2,
    BookingView = 3  // For future use
}
```

### Recently Visited Response Structure

```csharp
public class RecentlyVisitedDto
{
    public Guid HotelId { get; set; }
    public string HotelName { get; set; }
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }
    public int StarRating { get; set; }
    public string ImageUrl { get; set; }
    public DateTime LastVisited { get; set; }
    public decimal? MinPrice { get; set; }
}
```

### Enhanced Home Page Response

```csharp
public class HomePageDataDto
{
    public List<FeaturedDealDto> FeaturedDeals { get; set; }
    public List<CityDto> PopularDestinations { get; set; }
    public List<RecentlyVisitedDto>? RecentlyVisited { get; set; } // Null for anonymous users
    public DateTime LastUpdated { get; set; }
}
```

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Hotel Detail Views**: Users can view detailed hotel information
2. **Activity Tracking**: System tracks user hotel views automatically
3. **Recently Visited Display**: Authenticated users see recently visited hotels on home page
4. **Anonymous Users**: Feature gracefully handles non-authenticated users
5. **Performance**: Activity tracking adds <50ms to response times
6. **Data Management**: Users can clear their activity history

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: No noticeable impact on existing search functionality
2. **Privacy**: User activity data is properly secured and manageable
3. **Scalability**: Activity tracking scales with user base growth
4. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns following existing architecture
5. **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage for new functionality

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Authenticated users see "Recently Visited" section on home page
- [ ] Recently visited shows last 5 hotels viewed by the user
- [ ] Anonymous users don't see recently visited section
- [ ] Hotel detail page tracking works seamlessly
- [ ] No performance degradation in existing endpoints
- [ ] All new functionality has appropriate test coverage
- [ ] Configuration allows customization of tracking behavior

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Performance Impact**: Activity tracking could slow down hotel detail views
  - **Mitigation**: Asynchronous processing, performance monitoring

### Medium Risk

- **Database Growth**: User activity data could grow rapidly
  - **Mitigation**: Configurable retention periods, data archiving

### Low Risk

- **User Privacy Concerns**: Activity tracking raises privacy questions
  - **Mitigation**: Clear privacy controls, user data management

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### External Dependencies

- None (all functionality built on existing platform)

### Internal Dependencies

1. **Hotel Detail Endpoint**: Must be implemented first
2. **JWT Authentication**: Already exists, but needed for user context
3. **Entity Framework Core**: Already configured for new entities

### Technology Considerations

- **Async Processing**: Use background tasks for activity logging
- **Caching**: Consider caching recently visited data
- **Indexes**: Proper database indexing for performance
