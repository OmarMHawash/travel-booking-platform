## Welcome to the Travel Booking Platform

The Travel Booking Platform is the engine designed to power a modern, scalable travel and accommodation booking website. It's a backend system that handles everything from user accounts and secure authentication to advanced, real-time hotel searching.

While it is a fully functional application with production-ready components, its primary purpose is to serve as a high-quality, real-world example of enterprise-level software engineering. It's a blueprint for building robust, maintainable, and well-architected applications.

## What is the Goal of This Project?

This platform was built with two primary goals in mind:

- **A Learning & Demonstration Tool:** It serves as a live, practical example of modern backend architecture, including Clean Architecture, CQRS, and modular monolith design. It's built to showcase best practices in a tangible way.
- **A Foundation for a Real Application:** The architectural principles and code quality are not just for show. The project is a solid foundation that can be extended with booking and payment functionality to become a complete, production-grade application.

<Callout title="Who is this documentation for?" type="info">
  This documentation is crafted for two main audiences: **Developers** who want
  to understand, run, and contribute to the codebase, and **Architects or
  Technical Reviewers** who want to assess the project's design and quality.

## How to Use This Documentation

This site is organized to help you find the information you need as efficiently as possible. Hereâ€™s a quick guide to what you can find in each section:

- **Getting Started:** The first stop for any developer. This section provides a straightforward, step-by-step guide to setting up your local development environment and running the project in minutes.
- **Architecture:** The "big picture" view. Here you'll learn about the core design decisions, the modular structure, and why technologies like Clean Architecture and CQRS were chosen.
- **Developer Guide:** The rulebook for contributing. It covers our conventions for coding, error handling, validation, and testing to ensure consistency and quality.
- **How-To Guides:** A cookbook of practical recipes. Need to add a new API endpoint or a database entity? These guides provide short, focused tutorials for the most common development tasks.
- **API Reference:** The interactive map of all our API endpoints, powered by Swagger. Here you can see every available request and response and even test them live directly from your browser.
