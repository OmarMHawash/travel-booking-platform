The first step in setting up the project is to get a copy of the source code on your local machine.

Open your preferred terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project, and run the following Git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omarmhawash/travel-booking-platform.git
```

<Callout title="Using SSH" type="info">
If you prefer to use SSH instead of HTTPS, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:omarmhawash/travel-booking-platform.git
```

</Callout>

this will clone the repository to your local machine, once you have the repository, you can navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
cd travel-booking-platform
```
