To protect sensitive information like database credentials, this project uses .NET's `user-secrets` manager. This stores your connection string locally on your machine, outside of the project folder, so it won't be committed to source control.

Follow these steps from the **root directory** of the repository.

<Steps>
<Step>
### 1. Navigate to the Host Project

The `Host` project is the main entry point for the API and where the configuration is managed.

```bash
cd src/TravelBookingPlatform.Host
```

</Step>

<Step>
### 2. Set the Connection String Secret
Run the following commands to initialize user secrets for the project and set your unique database connection string.

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:Database" "YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING"
```

<Callout title="What should my connection string be?">
  Replace `YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING` with the string for your local SQL Server
  instance.
  "Server=localhost;Database=TravelBookingPlatform;Trusted_Connection=True;
  TrustServerCertificate=True;"
</Callout>

</Step>
