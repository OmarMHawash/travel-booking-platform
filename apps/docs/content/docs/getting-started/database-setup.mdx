import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

Now that the application is configured to connect to your database server, you need to create the database schema and populate it with initial data.

This project uses a single command to handle everything. From the `src/TravelBookingPlatform.Host` directory, run:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

This command will automatically:

1.  Connect to your SQL Server instance.
2.  Create a new database named `TravelBookingDb` (or as specified in your connection string).
3.  Apply all the table schemas required by the application.
4.  **Seed the database** with comprehensive sample data.

<Callout title="What's in the Sample Data?" type="info">
  The seeding process creates a realistic development environment for you,
  including:

  <ul>
  - An **Admin** user and a **Typical User**.
  - Multiple cities and hotels.
  - A variety of room types and rooms.
  - Featured deals and existing bookings for testing.
  </ul>
</Callout>

Your database is now ready. The final step is to run the application.
