You have now completed all the setup and configuration steps. It's time to run the API.

### Launching the API

From the `src/TravelBookingPlatform.Host` directory, execute the `dotnet run` command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will build and start a local web server. By default, it will be listening on the following URLs:

- **HTTPS:** `https://localhost:7123`
- **HTTP:** `http://localhost:5123`

### Verifying a Successful Setup

To confirm that everything is working correctly, open your web browser and check two key endpoints:

1.  **API Documentation:** Navigate to **[`https://localhost:7123/swagger`](https://localhost:7123/swagger)**.

    - You should see the interactive Swagger UI, listing all available API endpoints.

2.  **Health Check:** Navigate to **[`https://localhost:7123/health`](https://localhost:7123/health)**.
    - You should see a simple `Healthy` message, confirming a successful database connection.

<Callout title="Congratulations! You're All Set Up." type="success">
The platform is now running locally. You can start exploring the API using the Swagger documentation. Try logging in with the default credentials to test authenticated endpoints!

- **Admin User:** `admin@test.com` / `Password123!`
- **Typical User:** `user@test.com` / `Password123!`
