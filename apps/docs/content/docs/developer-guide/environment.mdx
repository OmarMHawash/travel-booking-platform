A consistent and well-understood development environment is key to productivity. This page outlines the standards and tools used in this project.

### Configuration Management

We use a standard .NET configuration approach with a key security consideration.

- **`appsettings.Development.json`**: This file, located in the `Host` project, contains non-sensitive configuration settings for the development environment. It is safe to commit to source control.
- **User Secrets**: For sensitive data like your local database connection string, we use the .NET Secret Manager. As outlined in the [Configuration](/docs/getting-started/configuration) guide, this keeps your credentials off source control. **Never store passwords or connection strings directly in `appsettings.json` files.**

### Coding Standards with `.editorconfig`

The repository includes an `.editorconfig` file at the root. This file defines a set of coding style rules (e.g., indentation, spacing, naming conventions) that are enforced by most modern IDEs, including Visual Studio, Rider, and VS Code.

This ensures that all code contributed to the project maintains a consistent format, regardless of the developer's personal editor settings.

### Database Seeding for Development

The first time you run `dotnet ef database update`, the application seeds the database with a rich set of sample data. This is designed to give you a fully functional environment to test against immediately.

<Callout>
  The seeding logic is located in the `SharedInfrastructure` project and is
  designed to run only if the database is empty, so it will not interfere with
  your existing data on subsequent runs.
