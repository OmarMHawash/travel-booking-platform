For diagnostics and observability, the project uses **Serilog** as its logging framework. We practice **structured logging**, which is a more powerful approach than traditional text-based logging.

### What is Structured Logging?

Instead of writing plain text messages, structured logging captures log events as key-value pairs (often in JSON format).

- **Plain Text:** `User 123 logged in from IP 192.168.1.1`
- **Structured Log:** `{"Message": "User logged in", "UserId": 123, "IpAddress": "192.168.1.1"}`

This makes log data easy to filter, search, and analyze in modern log aggregation tools (like Seq, Splunk, or ElasticSearch).

### How to Log

The standard .NET `ILogger<T>` interface is used throughout the application. Serilog is configured as the underlying provider. To add logging to a class, simply inject `ILogger<T>` into its constructor.

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyService> _logger;

    public MyService(ILogger<MyService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void DoSomething(Guid userId)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Starting operation for {UserId}", userId);

        try
        {
            // ... do work ...
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred during operation for {UserId}", userId);
        }
    }
}
```

### Configuration

Log sinks (the destinations for log events) are configured in `Program.cs` in the `Host` project. By default, we have configured:

- A **console sink** for easy viewing during local development.
- A **database sink** to store logs persistently.
- Automatic **request/response logging** middleware.

Log levels and other settings can be controlled via `appsettings.json`.
