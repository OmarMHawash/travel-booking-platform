import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

To support operational monitoring, the application exposes a health check endpoint. This provides a simple, external way to verify that the application is running and able to connect to its critical dependencies.

### The `/health` Endpoint

You can access the health check endpoint by making a `GET` request to `/health` on the application's base URL.

- **URL:** `https://localhost:7123/health`

### Health Check Responses

The endpoint will return an HTTP `200 OK` status and a simple body if all checks pass. If any check fails, it will return an HTTP `503 Service Unavailable`.

_Example Healthy Response:_

```json
{
  "status": "Healthy",
  "results": {
    "database": {
      "status": "Healthy",
      "description": "Database connection is healthy."
    }
  }
}
```

_Example Unhealthy Response:_

```json
{
  "status": "Unhealthy",
  "results": {
    "database": {
      "status": "Unhealthy",
      "description": "Failed to connect to the database."
    }
  }
}
```

### Current Checks

Currently, the health check system is configured to perform a single check:

- **Database Connectivity:** It executes a simple query (`SELECT 1`) to ensure it can successfully communicate with the SQL Server database.

<Callout>
  This endpoint is designed to be polled by automated monitoring tools,
  container orchestrators (like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm), or load balancers
  to determine if the application instance is healthy and should receive
  traffic.
