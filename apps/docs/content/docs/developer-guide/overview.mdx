Welcome to the development team! Working on the Travel Booking Platform is designed to be a structured and rewarding experience. The project is built with a strong emphasis on **clarity, maintainability, and code quality**, following established enterprise-level patterns.

### The Development Philosophy

Our core philosophy is to build software that is:

- **Easy to Understand:** By using patterns like Clean Architecture and CQRS, we ensure that every piece of code has a clear and logical home.
- **Easy to Test:** The separation of concerns makes it simple to write focused unit tests for business logic and comprehensive integration tests for API workflows.
- **Easy to Change:** Low coupling between modules and layers means that changes in one part of the system are less likely to break another.

### What to Expect

When you work on this project, you will primarily be interacting with:

- **CQRS Commands and Queries:** Most new features will involve creating a new command or query and its corresponding handler.
- **Domain Entities:** You will model and enrich business entities with rules and behavior accordingto Domain-Driven Design principles.
- **API Controllers:** You will expose application functionality through clean, versioned RESTful API endpoints.
- **FluentValidation:** You will add validation rules to ensure the integrity of incoming data.

This structured approach minimizes guesswork and helps you write high-quality, consistent code from day one.
