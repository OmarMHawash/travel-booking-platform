## The Blueprint of the Platform

Welcome to the architectural deep-dive of the Travel Booking Platform. This section explains the "why" and "how" behind the project's construction. The system is intentionally designed using enterprise-level patterns like **Clean Architecture, CQRS, and a Modular Monolith design** to ensure it is scalable, maintainable, and a pleasure for developers to work on.

Understanding these principles is key to contributing effectively and appreciating the project's structure.

### Core Design Principles

These guides cover the high-level patterns and physical layout of the solution.

### Feature Modules

The platform is built as a Modular Monolith, where distinct business capabilities are isolated into their own modules. Each module has its own internal layers and is responsible for a specific part of the domain.

<Callout>
  This structure provides clear boundaries and makes it easier to reason about
  the codebase, and even extract modules into separate microservices in the
  future.
