The Booking Module represents the functional area responsible for handling reservations. While the `Booking` entity is intrinsically linked to the Hotel Module's domain, we discuss its logic and status here as a distinct capability. This module is the final piece required to complete the platform's core workflow.

<Callout>
  The `Booking` domain entity exists and contains business rules for validation
  (e.g., preventing overlapping bookings), but the application services and API
  endpoints to interact with it have not yet been built.
</Callout>

### Key Responsibilities (Planned)

- **Creating Bookings:** Allowing users to reserve rooms for specific dates.
- **Availability Checks:** Ensuring a room is not double-booked.
- **Booking Management:** Providing users with a way to view and cancel their reservations.

### Domain Model

The `Booking` entity ties a user to a specific room for a check-in/check-out period.

```csharp title="Booking.cs"
Booking {
    Id: Guid (PK)
    UserId: Guid (FK)
    RoomId: Guid (FK)
    CheckInDate: DateTime
    CheckOutDate: DateTime
    CreatedAt: DateTime
    UpdatedAt: DateTime
}
```

### API Endpoints & Status

<Callout title="Module Status: Pending Implementation" type="error">
  There are **no implemented API endpoints** for the Booking Module. The entire
  controller, along with its backing CQRS commands and queries, needs to be
  created.
</Callout>

The following API is planned for implementation:

```http title="Planned API Endpoints"
# Booking Management (Controller & Logic Missing)
GET  /api/v1/bookings                    # Get bookings for the current user.
POST /api/v1/bookings                    # Create a new booking.
GET  /api/v1/bookings/{id}               # Get details for a specific booking.
PUT  /api/v1/bookings/{id}/cancel        # Cancel an existing booking.
```
