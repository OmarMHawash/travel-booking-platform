Unlike the other modules, the Shared Infrastructure projects do not represent a specific business capability. Instead, they provide the technical "glue" and common services that are used by all other modules in the application. This approach promotes code reuse and ensures consistency.

The two main projects are `Core` and `SharedInfrastructure`.

### Key Components & Responsibilities

- **`Core` Projects (`Core.Domain`, `Core.Application`):**

  - Contains base classes and interfaces that are fundamental to our architecture (e.g., `Entity`, `ValueObject`, `IUnitOfWork`, `IRequest`). It has the fewest dependencies.

- **`SharedInfrastructure` Project:**
  - **ApplicationDbContext:** The central EF Core `DbContext` that includes `DbSet` properties for entities from all modules.
  - **Unit of Work Pattern:** The concrete implementation for managing atomic transactions across multiple repository operations.
  - **Generic Repository:** A base repository implementation with common data access methods (`GetByIdAsync`, `Add`, etc.).
  - **Database Migrations:** The centralized location for all EF Core migrations.
  - **Global Middleware:** Handlers for global exception logging and RFC 7807-compliant error responses.
  - **Health Checks:** The `/health` endpoint implementation for monitoring database connectivity.

<Callout title="No Business Logic Here">
  These shared projects intentionally contain **no business-specific logic**.
  They are purely technical and foundational, providing the stable base upon
  which the `Identity` and `Hotels` modules are built.

### API Endpoints

This layer does not define business-specific API controllers. Its only contribution to the API surface is through middleware and services like the `/health` check endpoint.
