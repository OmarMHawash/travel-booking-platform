The Identity Module is a self-contained unit that handles all concerns related to users and security. It is the gatekeeper of the application, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access protected resources.

### Key Responsibilities

- **User Registration:** Onboarding new users with secure password hashing.
- **Authentication:** Verifying user credentials and issuing JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Authorization:** Enforcing access control using a role-based system (Admin, TypicalUser).
- **User Profile Management:** Allowing users to view their own data and change their passwords.

### Domain Model

The core of this module is the `User` entity, which represents a user in the system.

```csharp title="User.cs"
User {
    Id: Guid (PK)
    Email: string (unique, value object)
    PasswordHash: string
    FirstName: string
    LastName: string
    Role: enum (Admin, TypicalUser)
    IsActive: bool
    CreatedAt: DateTime
    UpdatedAt: DateTime
}
```

### API Endpoints

All endpoints required for the Identity module are fully implemented and operational.

```http title="Implemented API Endpoints"
# User Authentication & Registration
POST /api/v1/auth/register          # Creates a new user account.
POST /api/v1/auth/login             # Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.

# User Management (requires authentication)
POST /api/v1/auth/change-password   # Allows a user to change their own password.
GET  /api/v1/user/profile           # Retrieves the profile of the currently logged-in user.
GET  /api/v1/user/{id}              # Retrieves a specific user by ID (Admin only).
```
