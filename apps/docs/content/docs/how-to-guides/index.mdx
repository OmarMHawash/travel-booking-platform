## The Developer's Cookbook

Welcome to the How-to Guides. This section provides short, focused, step-by-step instructions for performing the most common development tasks on the platform. Think of these as recipes you can follow to build new features consistently and correctly.

<Callout>
  These guides assume you have a solid understanding of the concepts covered in
  the **[Architecture](/docs/architecture)** and **[Developer
